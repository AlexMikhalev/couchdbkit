Since I worked more and more with git and "github":http://github.com/benoitc, I decided to move Couchdbkit and Restkit to it:

* "couchdbkit":http://github.com/benoitc/couchdbkit
* "restkit": http://github.com/benoitc/restkit

All the history have been imported and new development will take place there.

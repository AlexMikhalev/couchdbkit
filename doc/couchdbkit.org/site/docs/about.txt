title: About CouchdbKit

**CouchDBKit** is a framework to allow your python application to use "Apache CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org. 

I started it for a project in my own company, **"Enki Multimedia":http://e-engura.org** but it since evolved in a completely new library though some code is still based on it. I decided to make it public.
